# HCPSS Style Guide Quick Start

## Installation and Opening

- Copy down this repository

If you haven't already installed the Fractal CLI helper on your machine, do that first from the root of the project:

```shell
npm i @frctl/fractal -g
```

- Use `npm install` to download all dependencies for the project. This may take a while.

Then:

- Use `fractal start --sync` from the directory root when running this styleguide. This automatically reloads the browser as you make changes.

- Adding some styles? While it's not necessary for just viewing the guide, run `gulp` in a new terminal window to compile styles as you add them to the styleguide

- Open up a new browser window and point it to `localhost:3000`

## Adding Styles

Information forthcoming.
