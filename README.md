# HCPSS Style Guide Quick Start

## Installation and Opening

If you haven't already installed the Fractal CLI helper on your machine, do that first:

```shell
npm i @frctl/fractal -g
```

Then:

- Use 'fractal start --sync' when running this styleguide. This automatically reloads the browser as you make changes.

- Open up the style guide in a new browser window and point it to `localhost:3000`

- Run `gulp` in a new terminal window to compile styles as you add them to the styleguide
