		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>The Howard County Public School System’s mathematics program is built upon the HCPSS Mathematics Curriculum. The mathematics standards set a rigorous definition of college and career readiness by demanding that students develop a depth of understanding and ability to apply mathematics to real-life situations, as college students and employees regularly do. In prekindergarten through grade 8 mathematics, the standards lay a solid foundation in whole numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. Taken together, these elements support a student’s ability to learn and apply more demanding mathematics concepts and procedures in middle and high school.</p>
