<p>All motorists are required by law to stop when the red lights on buses are flashing. To pass a bus when the right lights are on is, by far, the greatest threat to the safety of the students. The refusal to stop for a school bus when the flashing red lights are in operation is punishable by a traffic ticket and fine of up to $1,000. Motorists should be aware that the red flashing lights and the stop sign might be engaged shortly after the bus’ amber lights are turned on. All drivers should decrease their speed and be prepared to stop when they see a school bus beginning to slow down and when students are present on the roadside.</p>
