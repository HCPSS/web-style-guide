  <p>Theatre Arts provides the opportunity for students in Grades 9-12 to establish life-long relationships with theatrical expression. Theatre instruction combines the study of theatre history and dramatic literature with the development of interpretive and emotional skills. The curriculum encompasses appreciation and demonstration of technical theatre craft and critical acumen. Theatre is a collaborative activity involving the participation of artists, technicians, and the presence of an audience.
  <p>Dance Education promotes aesthetic sensitivity and provides an opportunity for students to experience intellectual, physical, emotional and social growth. Students observe, respond, create, and perform using the body as an instrument to communicate feelings, thoughts, and ideas. Through exploring dance concepts, students demonstrate critical thinking skills and core values as well as develop personal integrity. Dance education fosters positive student interaction and an appreciation for diverse points of view, while establishing strong human bonds which transcend racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic barriers. The sequentially developed program presents a broad cultural and historical perspective, providing unique opportunities for cross-curricular connections.</p>
